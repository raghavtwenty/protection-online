### PROBLEM

Design and prototype innovative app or software-based solutions that can detect the use,type, and scale of dark patterns on e-commerce platforms.
<br><br><br>


### OUR OBJECTIVE

1. Privacy policy summarization <br>
2. Website cookie acceptance/rejection <br>
3. Detection of malicious URLs
<br><br><br>


### INTRODUCTION

Law enforcement and policies are changing from time to time especially in the cyber world. Users find it difficult and have no time to read the entire user agreement and privacy laws before using any application. The companies and application developers take advantage of it and make it even more difficult for the end users to show them fully on the data they collect from the users which are not necessary. Legitimate and malicious websites are hard to find for common users. To overcome the challenges we have stepped into "Protection Online". 
<br><br><br>


### TECHNOLOGIES USED

1. Generative AI <br>
2. Replicate <br>
3. LLM - Mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1 <br>
4. Virus Total Malicious URL Analyzer <br>
5. WHOIS Database 
<br><br><br>


### WORKING

1. First the user enters the privacy policy link of a website or domain. <br>
2. Then it gathers the details about the domain from WHOIS database and checks for SSL Certification. <br>
3. After that it web scraps the complete privacy policy text of the domain. <br>
4. Now it passes the privacy policy to the LLM for summarization. <br>
5. Finally using Virus total API, It analyzes the domain for safety check and scoring.
